The scripts I have selected to showcase for this project are "GameManagerScript.cs" and "MoveToEgg.cs".

The game manager script handles most of the game code; pausing, adverts, spawning and handling waves, detecting touches etc

MoveToEgg script uses assigned values to move itself (a sperm) towards the egg, as well as rotating along the circle to give a swim effect. It also detects if it collides with the egg to call the EndGame function in GameManager.
